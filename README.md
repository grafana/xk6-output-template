# xk6-output-template
Is template for k6 output [extensions](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/what-are-k6-extensions/)

You should make a repo from this template and go through the code and replace everywhere where it says `template` in order to use it.
There are more instructions and comments inline.

> :warning: the API of k6 outputs [will likely change in the future](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2430), so repos using it (like this repo) are not guaranteed to be working with any future version of k6.
